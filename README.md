# Clocktaurs campaign deciphering experiment

For the second time this campaign, we have been beset by an encrypted message. This time, we can use python to solve it, and we will. The snake, of course, not the programming language. What am I, some sort of wizard?

## Startup

```
git clone https://github.com/frank1010111/decrypt_clockwork.git
cd decrypt_clockwork
uv run --with jupyter jupyter-lab
```

Then you can work through the notebooks. Start with [`frequency-analysis`](https://github.com/frank1010111/decrypt_clockwork/blob/main/frequency-analyis.ipynb) if you want to see how I started. Then, for the decrypted journal, check out [`decrypt-this-please`](https://github.com/frank1010111/decrypt_clockwork/blob/main/decrypt-this-please.ipynb).

If you don't have uv installed, first of all, that's very sad. Check [their install docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
